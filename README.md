janitor
=====

The janitor does the dirty work - enables site updates from anywhere.

Janitor is a content management framework. It is NOT a CMS - and it is not to become a CMS. It has been designed to build custom content managements systems.
It provides a flexible item model and a set of utlitilies to handle most CMS-related tasks. You do the rest.

Currently in alpha state, while transitioning from old framework source.
